      <b> Akshay Hari Om Bhatia[1] (born Rajiv Hari Om Bhatia; 9 September 1967[2]), </b> known professionally as Akshay Kumar
        (pronounced [əkˈʂəj kʊˈmɑːɾ]), is an Indian actor and film producer working in Hindi cinema. Referred to in the
        media as "Khiladi Kumar",[3][4] through his career spanning over 30 years, Kumar has appeared in over 150 films
        and has won several awards, including two National Film Awards and two Filmfare Awards. He received the Padma
        Shri, India's fourth-highest civilian honour, from the Government of India in 2009. Kumar is one of the most
        prolific actors in Indian cinema.[5][6] Forbes included Kumar in their lists of both highest-paid celebrities
        and highest-paid actors in the world from 2015 to 2020.[7][8] Between 2019 and 2020, he was the only Indian on
        both lists.[9][10][11]

        While his career had fluctuated commercially, his mainstream success soared in 2007 with four consecutive box-office hits; it was consistent until a short period of decline between 2009 and 2011, after which he reinforced his status with several films, including Rowdy Rathore (2012) and Holiday (2014). Moreover, around this time critical response to several of his films improved; his work in Special 26 (2013), Baby (2015), Airlift (2016), and Jolly LLB 2 (2017) was acclaimed, and he won the National Film Award for Best Actor for the crime thriller Rustom (2016). He earned further notice for his self-produced social films Toilet: Ek Prem Katha (2017) and Pad Man (2018), as well as the war film Kesari (2019), and set box-office records in 2019 with Mission Mangal, Housefull 4, Good Newwz, and the 2021 action film Sooryavanshi. All of Kumar's subsequent theatrical releases failed commercially, with the exception of the comedy-drama OMG 2 (2023).[12]

        In addition to acting, Kumar has worked as a stunt actor.[a] In 2008, he started hosting Fear Factor: Khatron Ke Khiladi, which he did for four seasons. He also launched the TV reality show Dare 2 Dance in 2014 and his off-screen work includes ownership of the team Khalsa Warriors in the World Kabaddi League. The actor had also set up martial arts training schools for women safety in the country.[14][15] Kumar is one of the India's most philanthropic actor and supports various charities. He is a leading brand endorser celebrity in India.[16] From 2011 to 2023, he was a citizen of Canada.[17][18
